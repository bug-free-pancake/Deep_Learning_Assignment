# Deep Learning Group Assignment â€“ Driver Inattention Detection

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the Deep Learning course.  
The goal was to build and evaluate deep learning models to classify driver attention states based on image data. The task was framed as a multi-class image classification problem using CNNs and transfer learning.

The dataset contains driver images annotated with 6 possible attention states:
- Safe driving
- Dangerous driving
- Distracted
- Drinking
- Sleepy driving
- Yawn

## Task Objectives

We completed the following tasks as part of this assignment:

- Built a **baseline CNN model** as specified in the assignment (3 convolution blocks + 2 dense layers)
- Visualized:
  - A bar plot showing class label distribution
  - A grid of 15 randomly selected labeled images
- Trained and evaluated the baseline model (10 epochs)
  - Accuracy & loss curves
  - ROC curve and AUC score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Improved the model through **custom architecture and hyperparameter tuning**
- Applied **transfer learning** using pretrained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50, or DenseNet121)
- Compared results across models and discussed performance
